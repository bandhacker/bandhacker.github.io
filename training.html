        <h1>optimal.efficient</h1>
            <p>The optimal.efficient platform is an attempt to use crowdsourced experience to make the act of selecting band literature simpler. The goal is to help you pick the <b>optimal</b> piece in an <b>efficient</b> way. The platform seeks to go beyond mono-dimensional grade designations in order to allow you to find the perfect piece for your band.</p>
        <h2>The 6 Nodes</h2>
            <p>Rather than a single number to tell you how hard it is, each piece in the optimal.efficient database gets 6 numbers. Each number corresponds to a specific node of difficulty. You will use these nodes when assessing your band, assessing whether a piece of music is good for your band, and if you decide to help the project and analyze some music.</p>
            <p><b>Rapidity</b> refers to the speed with which the muscles involved in music-making need to move in order to perform the music. It is related to, but not synonymous with, <i>tempo</i>. It principally refers to <i>finger motion</i> and <i>tongue motion</i>.</p>
        <p><b>Rhythm</b> refers to the complexity of the <i>rhythms</i> present in the piece. This includes both the rhythms any given individual must read as well as the relationship between rhythms in multiple groups. It can include peculiarities in the way a rhythm is written, even if it is easier to perform than it looks. It does not refer to the quantity or variety of simultaneous rhythms.</p>
        <p><b>Dynamics</b> refers to changes in volume initiated by the performers. It does not refer to changes in volume caused by changes in texture.</p>
        <p><b>Texture</b> refers to the number and nature of simultaneous, different musical lines. For example, difficulty can arise from a large quantity of distinct lines or exposure from thin scoring.</p>
        <p><b>Tonality</b> refers to the key(s) (or lack thereof) and amount of chromaticism used in the work. The difficulty arises from the use of less-familiar notes and motions between notes. Care must be taken to distinguish difficulty related to <b>tonality</b> from difficulty related to <b>rapidity</b>. A fast run in the key of B&#9837 has mostly rapidity difficulty, while the same run in B&#9838 has both rapidity and tonality difficulty. However, the rapidity difficulty of the run in B&#9838 can be said to increase over that of the run in B&#9837 due to the relationship between these two factors.</p>
        <p><b>Range</b> refers to the height or depth of pitches that must be played relative to the typical ranges of the instruments. Primary concerns are <i>trumpet</i> and <i>clarinet</i>, with <i>flute</i> and <i>all other brass</i> as secondary concerns.</p>
        <h2>Instrumentation</h2>
            <p>The optimal.efficient platform utilizes a standard concert band consisting of the following <i>parts</i>:</p>
             <li>1 Flute</li>
             <li>2 Clarinets</li>
             <li>3 Saxophones (Alto, Tenor, Baritone)</li>
             <li>2 Trumpets</li>
             <li>1 F Horn</li>
             <li>1 Trombone</li>
             <li>1 Baritone</li>
             <li>1 Tuba</li>
             <li>1-6 Percussion</li>

             <p>This does <i>not</i> mean that the average band is assumed to have only this many instrumentalists, but rather that the average band is expected to be able to confidently perform this many different parts. For example, four clarinettists may be only able to effectively cover two parts if two are of a lesser skill level than the band's average.</p>
    <p>If a piece requires more or less than the average number listed above, this is assessed as part of the analysis process and is reflected below the difficulty graph.</p>
             <p>Percussion is handled slightly differently. When analyzing a piece, raters should indicate the bare minimum number of percussionists required to perform the piece. The average of these entries, rounded up, is displayed.</p>

        <h2>Rating Music</h2>
            <p>When rating music, use the standard of "This piece's ___________ has the difficulty of a grade ___________ piece." This is extremely subjective, and is intended to be such. The validity of optimal.efficient comes not from specific parameters for grading, but from the aggregation of opinions from a multitide if directors. When a piece is graded by more than one person, optimal.efficient gives you the average rating. As more people grade the same piece, a consensus is reached.</p>
