        <div class="panel">
            <p>The optimal.efficient platform is an attempt to use crowdsourced experience to make the act of selecting band literature simpler. The goal is to help you pick the <b>optimal</b> piece in an <b>efficient</b> way. The platform seeks to go beyond mono-dimensional grade designations in order to allow you to find the perfect piece for your band.</p>
        </div>

        <button class="accordion">Using the Site</button>
        <div class="panel">
            <ul>
                <li><b>Load a band</b> by entering the information in the input fields and clicking "Load Band." You can use the demo band by entering "1" without the quotes in both boxes.</li>
                <li><b>Create a band</b> once you're familiar with the rating system by clicking "New Band" and following the Google Forms prompts.</li>
                <li><b>Search</b> lets you search by title, composer, and/or arranger. Make sure to check the appropriate box(es).</li>
                <li><b>List Optimal</b> shows you all pieces that match your band perfectly in terms of difficulty profile.</li>
                <li><b>List Playable</b> shows you all pieces that have difficulty profiles within your band's abilities.</li>
                <li><b>List Challenging</b> shows you pieces that will stretch your students by only one level in one to six of the nodes. The "Challenge Level" is the number of nodes that will stretch your band's abilites.</li>
                <li><b>List All</b> shows you every piece in the database.</li>
                <li><b>Submit Analysis</b> takes you to a Google Form that allows you to submit your analysis of a piece.</li>
                <li><b>Report Duplicate</b> tries to opens your default mail app and start an email message to optimal.efficient. Use this when you think you might have found a piece listed twice in the database.</li>

        <button class="accordion">The 6 Nodes</button>
        <div class="panel">
            <p>Rather than a single number to tell you how hard it is, each piece in the optimal.efficient database gets 6 numbers. Each number corresponds to a specific element of difficulty. You will use these elements when assessing your band, assessing whether a piece of music is good for your band, and if you decide to help the project and analyze some music.</p>

                <summary>Rapidity</summary>
                <p><b>Rapidity</b> refers to the speed with which the muscles involved in music-making need to move in order to perform the music. It is related to, but not synonymous with, <i>tempo</i>. It principally refers to <i>finger motion</i> and <i>tongue motion</i>. It does not refer to rapid dynamic changes.</p>
            </details>

            <details>
                <summary>Rhythm</summary>
                <p><b>Rhythm</b> refers to the complexity of the <i>rhythms</i> and <i>meters</i> present in the piece. This includes both the rhythms any given individual must read as well as the relationship between rhythms in multiple groups. Patterns of <i>articulations</i> are included as well. It can also include peculiarities in the way a rhythm is written, even if it is easier to perform than it looks. It does not refer to the quantity or variety of simultaneous rhythms.</p>
            </details>

            <details>
                <summary>Dynamics</summary>
                <p><b>Dynamics</b> refers to required volumes and changes in volume initiated by the performers. Soft volumes are of particular concern. The <i>frequency</i> and <i>range</i> of dynamic changes ar eto be considered. It does not refer to changes in volume caused by changes in texture.</p>
            </details>

            <details>
                <summary>Texture</summary>
                <p><b>Texture</b> refers to the number and nature of simultaneous, distinct musical lines. Texture difficulty typically arises from a large quantity of distinct lines or exposure from thin scoring. Related concepts include <i>transparency</i> and <i>uniformity</i></p>
            </details>

            <details>
                <summary>Tonality</summary>
                <p><b>Tonality</b> refers to the key(s) (or lack thereof) and amount of chromaticism used in the work. The difficulty arises from the use of less-familiar notes and motions between notes. Care must be taken to distinguish difficulty related to <b>tonality</b> from difficulty related to <b>rapidity</b>. A fast run in the key of B&#9837 has mostly rapidity difficulty, while the same run in B&#9838 has both rapidity and tonality difficulty. However, the rapidity difficulty of the run in B&#9838 can be said to increase over that of the run in B&#9837 due to the relationship between these two factors.</p>
            </details>

            <details>
                <summary>Range</summary>
                <p><b>Range</b> refers to the height or depth of pitches that must be played relative to the typical ranges of the instruments. Primary concerns are <i>trumpet</i> and <i>clarinet</i>, with <i>flute</i> and <i>all other brass</i> as secondary concerns.</p>
            </details>     

        <p>Concepts such as "expression," "aesthetic," and "style" are not included. These are not elements of difficulty, but rather are the result of the mastery of the identified six elements and their interactions. They are important, but are not fundamental in determining whether a piece is playable.</p>

        <button class="accordion">Instrumentation</button>
        <div class="panel">
            <p>The optimal.efficient platform utilizes a standard concert band consisting of <i>parts</i> rather than <i>players</i>, as not every player can cover a part alone.</p>

             <li>1 Flute (F)</li>
             <li>No Oboe (O)</li>

                <li>Standard instrumentation is highlighted in green and is listed on the top row.</li>
                <li>Expanded instrumentation is highlighted in orange and is on the bottom row.</li>

        <button class="accordion">How to Rate Music</button>
        <div class="panel">
            <h5>What to Grade</h5>
            <p>It is vital that you only rate music you've taught. We can all look at a score and get an idea of what's on the page, but the value of optimal.efficient is in the opinions of those who have had practical experience with the music.</p>
            
            <h5>How to Grade Difficulty</h5>
            <p>When rating music or your band, use a standard of "This piece's ___________ has the difficulty of a grade ___________ piece." As more people grade the same piece, a consensus is reached, and optimal.efficient gives you that consensus in the form of an average rating.</p>

            <p>A quick word on <b>marches</b> is necessary. Marches should be graded as if they are not marches; i.e. no comparison with "other marches" should be made. This will mean that the ratings of tonality, texture, and likely dynamics will typically be lower than the other nodes for marches.</p>

            <h5>How to Grade Instrumentation</h5>
            <p>When rating the instrumentation for a piece, you are presented with two or three options for each instrument. For three-option instruments, the center option is the standard option. For baritone and tuba, "Yes" is the standard option. For bassoon and oboe, the standard option is "No."</p>
